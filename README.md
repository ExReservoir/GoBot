# GoBot
A simple bot using the Rocket API for Pokemon Go.


# Warning
This is not a fully functioning bot. This was made in only a couple of hours. The API that this uses changes several hundred times a day.
If you build from source there may be some small issues to fix (as you will have to download the API too!)
